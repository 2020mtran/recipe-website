Do not stir or mix it. While cutting into the rice you should be fanning it at the same time to cool it down. Do this for about 5 minutes. You can stop fanning once most of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Then let it cool to body temperature. Place on the counter and cover the bowl with a damp towel to prevent the rice from drying out. Do not refrigerate as it will harden the rice.", ""],
